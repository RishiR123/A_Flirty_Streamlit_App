## 🤖 I'm Something Else...

I didn’t choose the bug life… the bug life chose me.  
So I fought back with **emojis**, **sass**, and **Python**. 💅🐍

While others **touch grass**, I touch **code**.  
And now... I’ve built an app that flirts, roasts, and emotionally blackmails until they say **"yes"** 💘😈
